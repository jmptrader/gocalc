1 - Introduction
================

Calc is a toy programming language. It's original design was to stand as a
simple language spec by which to build a compiler and/or interpreter around.
It is meant as a teaching tool for compiler design and little to no thought
has been given to its suitabily for a general purpose programming language.

It uses Lisp/Scheme-like syntax. It's only basic type is an integer. It is
not an implementation of any language despite any similarities it may bare
to other languages.

2 - Installation
================

If you want to tinker and use the language it is best to clone a copy of the
project from it's github page. You will need a copy of Go 1.x installed to
compile the project.

If you wish to simply use the interpreter for some odd reason, you could
probably also use the 'go get' tool.
